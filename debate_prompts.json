        "debate_topic": "The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a global debate over whether intellectual property rights on life-saving vaccines should be temporarily waived under the WTO's TRIPS agreement. India and other developing nations pushed for a waiver to accelerate global vaccine production and access. Switzerland, a major hub of pharmaceutical research, opposed the waiver, arguing it would harm innovation and global preparedness for future pandemics. In this debate, both parties will present their case on whether TRIPS flexibility should be exercised in emergencies, balancing IP protection with global public health needs. The discussion should remain grounded in WTO frameworks, international law, and pandemic response ethics."
