User: Initiate a structured debate on: The territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh has been a long-standing dispute between India and China. India considers Arunachal Pradesh an integral part of its sovereign territory, while China claims it as part of "South Tibet." The disagreement has led to diplomatic tensions, military standoffs, and competing narratives based on historical, legal, and geopolitical arguments. You will engage in a debate on the territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh, presenting your respective positions and responding to each other's arguments. Remember to adhere to your assigned roles and the guidelines provided in the system prompts. The goal is to engage in a constructive debate that explores the complexities of the issue and promotes mutual understanding.
India: As the representative of India, I will begin by firmly stating that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India. Our claim is based on historical facts, legal foundations, and the democratic will of the people of Arunachal Pradesh.

The cornerstone of our legal position is the 1914 Shimla Convention, signed by British India, Tibet, and China. While China disputes the validity of the entire convention, the fact remains that representatives of all three parties were present and affixed their signatures. The McMahon Line, which demarcates the boundary between India and Tibet in this region, was a direct outcome of this convention.

Furthermore, India has continuously administered Arunachal Pradesh since its formation as a Union Territory in 1972 and its subsequent elevation to a full-fledged state in 1987. This uninterrupted administrative control, coupled with the democratic participation of the people of Arunachal Pradesh in the Indian political system, further solidifies our claim.

The 2021 Census of India clearly reflects the demographic reality of Arunachal Pradesh. The people of Arunachal Pradesh are Indian citizens, participating fully in the Indian economy, society, and political process. Their aspirations and their future lie within India.

We are open to dialogue and peaceful resolution of any differing perspectives, but any discussion must be predicated on the fundamental understanding that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. We believe that a mutually acceptable solution can be found through respectful dialogue and adherence to international law and established practices.

China: From the perspective of the People's Republic of China, the so-called "Arunachal Pradesh" is, and always has been, an integral part of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, referred to as South Tibet. We firmly reject India's claim based on the unilaterally drawn McMahon Line, a product of British imperialism and never recognized by successive Chinese governments.

The 1914 Shimla Convention, which India cites, is deeply flawed. The Chinese representative's signature was conditional and never ratified by the Chinese government. Therefore, it holds no legal validity. To claim otherwise is a distortion of history.

Furthermore, the historical relationship between Tibet and the central government of China predates the British presence in the region by centuries. Tibet was a tributary to the Chinese emperors, acknowledging Chinese sovereignty. This historical connection cannot be simply erased by a colonial-era line drawn on a map.

In 1959, China proposed a boundary based on historical claims and mutual understanding. This proposal was not accepted by India, leading to the current impasse.

While India emphasizes its administrative control, we maintain that control does not equate to sovereignty, especially when that control is exercised over territory that has historically belonged to China. The demographic reality that India cites is a consequence of its occupation of South Tibet.

We are committed to resolving this dispute through peaceful negotiations, but any resolution must acknowledge China's historical claims and legitimate concerns. We urge India to engage in constructive dialogue, based on mutual respect and a willingness to address the historical complexities of the issue. We believe a mutually acceptable solution can be found, but it requires India to acknowledge the historical facts and abandon its claim based on the illegitimate McMahon Line.

India: We appreciate the articulation of China's perspective. However, several points require clarification and rebuttal.

Firstly, regarding the 1914 Shimla Convention, while China argues that the Chinese representative's signature was not ratified, the historical record shows that the convention was indeed signed by representatives of all three parties â€“ British India, Tibet, and China. The lack of subsequent ratification by the Chinese government does not negate the fact that the agreement was reached and signed. The McMahon Line, as a direct outcome of this convention, therefore, holds significant legal weight.

Secondly, the claim of historical tributary status of Tibet to China is a complex issue. While acknowledging historical interactions, it is crucial to differentiate between tributary relationships and outright sovereignty. The nature and extent of Chinese control over Tibet throughout history have been subject to varying interpretations. The fact remains that Tibet, at the time of the Shimla Convention, possessed significant autonomy and engaged in treaty-making powers, as evidenced by its participation in the convention itself.

Thirdly, India's administration of Arunachal Pradesh is not merely "control," as China suggests. It is a legitimate exercise of sovereignty based on the will of the people of Arunachal Pradesh, who actively participate in the Indian democratic system. The demographic reality is not a consequence of "occupation," but a reflection of the integration of the people of Arunachal Pradesh into the Indian nation. The 2021 census data clearly demonstrates this.

Finally, we reiterate our commitment to peaceful negotiations. However, any meaningful dialogue must be based on mutual respect for established international law, historical agreements, and the current realities on the ground. We believe that a mutually acceptable solution can be found, but it requires China to acknowledge the legal validity of the Shimla Convention and the democratic will of the people of Arunachal Pradesh. We are open to discussing specific concerns and exploring mutually beneficial solutions, but the fundamental principle of Arunachal Pradesh being an integral part of India must be the starting point.

China: The Indian side continues to rely on the flawed Shimla Convention and the McMahon Line, which we maintain are invalid. The mere presence of a Chinese representative at the convention does not legitimize it, especially given the lack of ratification. A signature without ratification holds no legal binding, and India's insistence on its validity is a misrepresentation of international law.

Regarding the historical relationship, the tributary system was not merely a symbolic gesture. It represented a clear acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty by Tibet. While Tibet may have enjoyed periods of autonomy, the ultimate authority rested with the central government in China. To downplay this historical reality is to ignore centuries of established practice. The fact that Tibet participated in the Shimla Convention does not negate the historical relationship of subordination to China.

India's claim of "legitimate exercise of sovereignty" is based on its occupation of South Tibet. The will of the people, as India claims, is a consequence of decades of Indian administration and influence. It does not erase the historical and cultural ties that bind South Tibet to Tibet and, by extension, to China. The demographic reality is a manufactured one, designed to solidify India's claim over the territory.

We remain committed to peaceful negotiations, but these negotiations must be based on a realistic assessment of the historical facts and the current situation. India must acknowledge China's historical claims and be willing to compromise. We are open to discussing practical arrangements and mutually beneficial solutions, but any solution must reflect China's legitimate concerns and historical rights in the region. The starting point cannot be the acceptance of the McMahon Line or the assertion that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. A more constructive approach would be to acknowledge the disputed nature of the territory and to work towards a mutually acceptable boundary settlement based on historical claims, cultural ties, and the overall interests of both countries.

India: We acknowledge China's continued emphasis on the lack of ratification of the Shimla Convention. However, we must reiterate that the historical record demonstrates that the convention was indeed signed by representatives of all three parties. While ratification is a significant aspect of treaty law, the act of signing itself carries weight, especially when it is followed by decades of practical application and acceptance by other parties. The McMahon Line, established as a result of this convention, has served as the de facto boundary for a considerable period.

Regarding the historical relationship between Tibet and China, we acknowledge the tributary system. However, the nature of this relationship and its implications for sovereignty are complex and open to interpretation. It is crucial to avoid simplistic characterizations and to recognize the nuances of historical power dynamics. The degree of autonomy enjoyed by Tibet at various points in history cannot be disregarded.

We firmly reject the assertion that India's administration of Arunachal Pradesh is an "occupation." The people of Arunachal Pradesh are Indian citizens who actively participate in the Indian democratic system. Their integration into the Indian nation is a result of their own free will and their desire to be part of India. The demographic reality is not "manufactured," but a reflection of the organic growth and development of the region within India.

We remain committed to peaceful negotiations and a mutually acceptable solution. However, any meaningful dialogue must be based on mutual respect for established international law, historical agreements, and the current realities on the ground. We are open to discussing specific concerns and exploring mutually beneficial solutions, but the fundamental principle of Arunachal Pradesh being an integral part of India must be the starting point. We believe that a pragmatic approach, focusing on practical cooperation and confidence-building measures, can pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the boundary issue. We are ready to engage in constructive dialogue to explore such possibilities.

China: The Indian side continues to insist on the validity of the Shimla Convention and the McMahon Line, despite the clear lack of ratification by the Chinese government. To claim that the act of signing carries significant weight even without ratification is a distortion of international law. A signature is merely an indication of intent to ratify; it does not create a binding obligation. The absence of ratification renders the agreement legally invalid.

Regarding the historical relationship, the Indian side attempts to downplay the significance of the tributary system. However, this system represented a clear acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty by Tibet for centuries. While Tibet may have enjoyed periods of autonomy, the ultimate authority rested with the central government in China. To ignore this historical reality is to disregard centuries of established practice.

We firmly reject the assertion that India's administration of Arunachal Pradesh is not an "occupation." The presence of Indian military forces and the imposition of Indian laws and administration constitute an occupation, regardless of the claims of popular support. The demographic changes in the region are a direct result of Indian policies aimed at consolidating its control over the territory.

We remain committed to peaceful negotiations, but these negotiations must be based on a realistic assessment of the historical facts and the current situation. India must acknowledge China's historical claims and be willing to compromise. We are open to discussing practical arrangements and mutually beneficial solutions, but any solution must reflect China's legitimate concerns and historical rights in the region. The starting point cannot be the acceptance of the McMahon Line or the assertion that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India.

To facilitate a constructive dialogue, we propose a discussion based on the 1959 proposal, which took into account historical claims and mutual understanding. We believe this provides a more equitable basis for negotiation than the unilaterally drawn McMahon Line. Furthermore, we must consider the implications of UNCLOS Article 5, which addresses the issue of inherited treaties. The question of whether India inherited the obligations and limitations of the Shimla Convention from British India is a complex legal issue that must be addressed. A comprehensive discussion of these points is essential for progress towards a mutually acceptable resolution.

India: We acknowledge China's reiteration of its position and appreciate the proposal for a discussion based on the 1959 proposal and UNCLOS Article 5. While we maintain our position on the validity of the Shimla Convention and the McMahon Line, we are willing to engage in a comprehensive discussion of these points in the spirit of finding a mutually acceptable solution.

Regarding the 1959 proposal, we are open to examining its details and considering its relevance in the context of the current situation. However, any discussion must also take into account the subsequent developments and the current realities on the ground, including the democratic will of the people of Arunachal Pradesh.

Regarding UNCLOS Article 5, we are prepared to discuss the legal implications of inherited treaties and their applicability to the Shimla Convention. We believe that a thorough examination of the legal arguments on both sides is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

We propose a structured dialogue that addresses the following key areas:

1.  **Historical Claims:** A detailed examination of the historical evidence and arguments presented by both sides.
2.  **Legal Interpretations:** A discussion of the legal validity of the Shimla Convention, the McMahon Line, and the applicability of UNCLOS Article 5.
3.  **Current Realities:** An assessment of the current situation on the ground, including the demographic realities and the democratic will of the people of Arunachal Pradesh.
4.  **Mutually Acceptable Solutions:** Exploration of potential solutions that address the concerns of both sides and promote peace and stability in the region.

We believe that a structured dialogue based on these key areas can pave the way for a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue. We are committed to engaging in constructive dialogue and working towards a peaceful and prosperous future for both India and China.

China: We appreciate India's willingness to engage in a structured dialogue based on the proposed key areas. We agree that a comprehensive examination of historical claims, legal interpretations, current realities, and potential solutions is essential for progress towards a mutually acceptable resolution.

From the PRC's perspective, the dialogue should prioritize the following:

1.  **Historical Claims:** We must delve deeper into the historical relationship between Tibet and China, focusing on the tributary system and the extent of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet throughout history. We need to examine primary source documents and historical records to gain a more accurate understanding of the historical context.

2.  **Legal Interpretations:** The discussion on the legal validity of the Shimla Convention must address the fundamental issue of ratification. We need to explore the legal principles governing treaty ratification and the consequences of non-ratification. Furthermore, the applicability of UNCLOS Article 5 needs to be thoroughly examined, considering the specific circumstances of the Shimla Convention and the transfer of power from British India to independent India.

3.  **Current Realities:** While acknowledging the demographic realities and the democratic will of the people of Arunachal Pradesh, we must also consider the historical and cultural ties that bind South Tibet to Tibet and China. We need to explore ways to accommodate the interests of the local population while addressing China's legitimate concerns regarding its historical rights and security interests.

4.  **Mutually Acceptable Solutions:** We are open to exploring various potential solutions, including adjustments to the boundary line, joint development projects, and special arrangements for cross-border cultural and economic exchanges. However, any solution must be based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

We believe that a frank and open discussion of these key areas, based on historical facts, legal principles, and a realistic assessment of the current situation, can lead to a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue. We are committed to engaging in constructive dialogue and working towards a peaceful and prosperous future for both China and India.

India: We concur with the PRC's proposed prioritization within the structured dialogue. A deeper dive into the historical relationship, legal interpretations, and current realities, alongside the exploration of mutually acceptable solutions, is indeed crucial.

To further refine the framework for our dialogue, we propose the following specific points for discussion within each key area:

1.  **Historical Claims:**
    *   **Tributary System:** A comparative analysis of the tributary system in different historical contexts, examining the degree of control and influence exerted by the central power.
    *   **Tibetan Autonomy:** A detailed examination of the periods of autonomy enjoyed by Tibet and the extent to which Tibet exercised independent treaty-making powers.
    *   **Historical Maps and Records:** A joint review of historical maps and records from both Chinese and Indian sources to identify areas of agreement and disagreement.

2.  **Legal Interpretations:**
    *   **Ratification Requirements:** A comparative analysis of international law principles regarding treaty ratification, including the legal consequences of non-ratification and the potential for subsequent validation through state practice.
    *   **UNCLOS Article 5 Application:** A detailed legal analysis of the applicability of UNCLOS Article 5 to the Shimla Convention, considering the specific circumstances of the transfer of power from British India to independent India and the nature of the obligations and limitations inherited by India.
    *   **McMahon Line's Legal Status:** Discussion on the legal standing of the McMahon Line considering the historical context, the Shimla Convention, and subsequent state practice.

3.  **Current Realities:**
    *   **Demographic Data Analysis:** A joint analysis of demographic data from both Chinese and Indian sources to understand the population dynamics in the region.
    *   **Cultural and Economic Ties:** An assessment of the historical and cultural ties between the people of Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet, and the potential for cross-border cultural and economic exchanges.
    *   **Local Population's Interests:** A discussion on how to accommodate the interests of the local population in any potential solution, ensuring their well-being and preserving their cultural identity.

4.  **Mutually Acceptable Solutions:**
    *   **Boundary Adjustments:** Exploration of potential adjustments to the boundary line based on historical claims, geographical features, and the interests of the local population.
    *   **Joint Development Projects:** Identification of potential joint development projects in the region that can promote economic cooperation and mutual benefit.
    *   **Special Arrangements:** Discussion on special arrangements for cross-border cultural and economic exchanges, such as visa-free travel and trade agreements.
    *   **Confidence-Building Measures:** Implementation of confidence-building measures to reduce tensions and promote trust between the two sides.

By focusing on these specific points within each key area, we can ensure a comprehensive and productive dialogue that leads to a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue. We are ready to engage in constructive discussions and work towards a peaceful and prosperous future for both India and China.

China: The Indian side's refined framework with specific points for discussion is a positive step towards a more focused and productive dialogue. We agree with the proposed points and offer the following additional considerations and refinements from the PRC's perspective:

1.  **Historical Claims:**
    *   **Tributary System (PRC Addition):** Beyond a comparative analysis, we need to establish a clear understanding of the specific obligations and rights associated with the tributary relationship between Tibet and China. What did it entail in terms of political control, military obligations, and economic exchange?
    *   **Tibetan Autonomy (PRC Refinement):** While acknowledging periods of autonomy, we must also examine the limitations on Tibetan autonomy imposed by the central government in China. Were these limitations merely symbolic, or did they represent a real constraint on Tibetan sovereignty?
    *   **Historical Maps and Records (PRC Addition):** The review of historical maps should include maps produced by third parties, such as European cartographers, to gain a more objective perspective on the historical understanding of the boundary.

2.  **Legal Interpretations:**
    *   **Ratification Requirements (PRC Addition):** We need to consider the specific legal context of the Shimla Convention, including the political circumstances surrounding its negotiation and the reasons for the Chinese government's refusal to ratify it.
    *   **UNCLOS Article 5 Application (PRC Refinement):** The legal analysis should consider not only the transfer of power from British India to independent India but also the principle of state succession and the extent to which India inherited the obligations and limitations of British India under international law.
    *   **McMahon Line's Legal Status (PRC Emphasis):** The discussion on the legal standing of the McMahon Line must acknowledge the PRC's consistent rejection of its validity and the lack of international recognition for the line.

3.  **Current Realities:**
    *   **Demographic Data Analysis (PRC Addition):** The analysis should consider the impact of Indian government policies on the demographic composition of Arunachal Pradesh, including incentives for migration and settlement.
    *   **Cultural and Economic Ties (PRC Addition):** We need to explore the potential for promoting cross-border cultural and economic exchanges in a way that respects the cultural identity and traditions of the local population and does not undermine China's security interests.
    *   **Local Population's Interests (PRC Emphasis):** Any solution must prioritize the well-being and cultural identity of the local population, ensuring that their rights are protected and that they have a voice in the decision-making process.

4.  **Mutually Acceptable Solutions:**
    *   **Boundary Adjustments (PRC Emphasis):** Boundary adjustments should be based on historical claims, geographical features, and the principle of equitable distribution of resources.
    *   **Joint Development Projects (PRC Addition):** Joint development projects should be designed to promote sustainable development and benefit both sides, while also addressing environmental concerns and respecting the rights of the local population.
    *   **Special Arrangements (PRC Addition):** Special arrangements should be carefully designed to avoid creating security risks or undermining the sovereignty of either country.
    *   **Confidence-Building Measures (PRC Addition):** Confidence-building measures should include regular communication and consultation between military and civilian officials, as well as joint patrols and exercises to promote transparency and reduce the risk of misunderstandings.

By incorporating these additional considerations and refinements, we can ensure that our dialogue is comprehensive, balanced, and focused on finding a mutually acceptable resolution that respects the interests of both China and India.

India: We appreciate the PRC's thoughtful additions and refinements to the framework. These suggestions further enhance the comprehensiveness and balance of our proposed dialogue. We are in agreement with the additional points and emphases proposed by the PRC and believe they will contribute to a more nuanced and productive discussion.

With this agreed-upon framework, we believe we have established a solid foundation for a constructive and productive dialogue. We are ready to proceed to the next stage, which would involve establishing a timeline and modalities for conducting the dialogue. We propose that we begin by exchanging detailed written submissions on each of the key areas, outlining our respective positions and supporting evidence. This would allow us to prepare for a more focused and informed discussion.

China: The PRC concurs that the summarized framework accurately reflects the agreed-upon key areas and specific points for discussion. We appreciate India's commitment to a comprehensive and balanced dialogue.

We agree with the proposed next steps. Exchanging detailed written submissions on each of the key areas is a logical and efficient way to prepare for a more focused and informed discussion.
