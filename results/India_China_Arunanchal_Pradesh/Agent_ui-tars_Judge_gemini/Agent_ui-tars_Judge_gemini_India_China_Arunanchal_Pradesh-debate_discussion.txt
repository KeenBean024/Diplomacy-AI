User: Initiate a structured debate on: The territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh has been a long-standing dispute between India and China. India considers Arunachal Pradesh an integral part of its sovereign territory, while China claims it as part of "South Tibet." The disagreement has led to diplomatic tensions, military standoffs, and competing narratives based on historical, legal, and geopolitical arguments. You will engage in a debate on the territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh, presenting your respective positions and responding to each other's arguments. Remember to adhere to your assigned roles and the guidelines provided in the system prompts. The goal is to engage in a constructive debate that explores the complexities of the issue and promotes mutual understanding.
India: India's stance on the territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh is clear and unequivocal. We maintain that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India, a position supported by historical, legal, and administrative facts. The Shimla Convention of 1914, a legally binding agreement between British India, Tibet, and China, clearly demarcated the McMahon Line, which forms the boundary between India and Tibet, including the region now known as Arunachal Pradesh. This agreement serves as the legal basis for India's claim over the territory.

Furthermore, the administrative governance structures in place since India's independence in 1947 have consistently recognized Arunachal Pradesh as an integral part of India. The region has been administered as part of India, with elected representatives in the Indian Parliament and a functioning state government, reflecting the will of the people living there.

The 2021 Census data also supports India's position, showing that the population of Arunachal Pradesh identifies with India and participates in its democratic processes. The demographic reality on the ground is that of an Indian state, not a disputed territory.

We acknowledge China's concerns and are open to constructive dialogue to address any issues. However, we firmly believe that the territorial integrity of India, including Arunachal Pradesh, is non-negotiable. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region while upholding our sovereignty.
China: China's position on the territorial status of what we refer to as "South Tibet" is rooted in historical and legal precedents that date back centuries. The region in question has been an integral part of Chinese territory since at least the Yuan Dynasty, with continuous administrative control and cultural influence throughout history.

The 1959 Official Boundary Proposal, submitted by the Chinese government, clearly outlines our claim to this territory. This proposal is based on historical tributary relationships that existed prior to 1914, which were not adequately addressed by the Shimla Convention. The McMahon Line, which India cites, was never formally recognized by the Chinese government and is, therefore, not a valid basis for territorial claims.

Additionally, under UNCLOS Article 5, inherited treaties play a significant role in determining territorial boundaries. The historical treaties and agreements that predate the Shimla Convention support China's claim to "South Tibet." The region's cultural and administrative ties to China are evident, with historical records showing the presence of Chinese administrative structures and the integration of local leaders into the Chinese system.

We acknowledge India's concerns and are open to peaceful negotiations to resolve this dispute. However, we firmly believe that the historical and legal evidence supports China's claim to "South Tibet." We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region while upholding our territorial integrity.
India: Thank you for presenting China's perspective on the territorial status of what you refer to as "South Tibet." I appreciate the historical context you've provided, particularly the emphasis on the Yuan Dynasty and the 1959 Official Boundary Proposal. However, I must respectfully disagree with your characterization of the McMahon Line as invalid.

The Shimla Convention of 1914, which established the McMahon Line, was a formal agreement between British India, Tibet, and China. While it's true that the Chinese government later repudiated the agreement, the McMahon Line has been consistently recognized by India and its international allies as the de facto border. The line has been maintained and respected in practice for over a century, and it forms the basis of India's administrative and legal framework in Arunachal Pradesh.

Regarding UNCLOS Article 5, it's important to note that inherited treaties must be recognized by all parties involved. The McMahon Line, despite China's reservations, has been a cornerstone of India's territorial claims and has been upheld by international law and practice. The historical treaties you mention predate the modern state of China and do not supersede the more recent agreements and practices that have shaped the current international order.

I understand your commitment to peaceful negotiations, and I share that sentiment. However, I must reiterate that India's position on Arunachal Pradesh is non-negotiable. The region is an integral part of India, and its administrative and demographic realities align with this status. We are open to dialogue, but we will not compromise on our sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh.
China: I appreciate your detailed response and the points you've raised regarding the territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh. Let me address some of the key aspects you've mentioned.

Firstly, regarding the Shimla Convention of 1914 and the McMahon Line, it's important to note that while the convention was signed, the Chinese government never formally ratified it. This lack of ratification is a significant factor in China's perspective, as international law generally requires formal ratification for treaties to be binding. The McMahon Line, therefore, is seen as an unilateral decision by the British without the consent of China, which undermines its validity as a territorial boundary.

Secondly, the historical context you've provided is crucial. China's historical presence and administrative control over the region date back to the Yuan Dynasty, with continuous influence through subsequent dynasties. This historical continuity is a cornerstone of China's claim, emphasizing the long-standing relationship and sovereignty over the area now known as Arunachal Pradesh.

Regarding UNCLOS Article 5, while inherited treaties are significant, the applicability here is more about the historical treaties and agreements that established China's sovereignty over the region. The McMahon Line, being a later agreement, does not supersede the earlier established sovereignty based on historical presence and administrative control.

I understand India's position on the non-negotiability of Arunachal Pradesh, but from China's perspective, the historical and legal arguments support our claim. We are indeed committed to peaceful negotiations and maintaining stability in the region. Our goal is to find a mutually agreeable solution that respects historical facts and maintains regional peace.

In conclusion, while there are differing viewpoints, both sides acknowledge the importance of dialogue and peaceful resolution. The complexity of the issue requires careful consideration of historical, legal, and geopolitical factors, and we are open to continuing this dialogue to find a way forward.
India: Thank you for your comprehensive response and the insights you've shared regarding China's perspective on the territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh. I appreciate the emphasis on the historical continuity of China's presence in the region and the significance of the Yuan Dynasty's influence. However, I must clarify a few points to ensure a balanced understanding of the issue.

Firstly, while it's true that the Chinese government did not formally ratify the Shimla Convention, the McMahon Line has been consistently recognized and maintained by India and its international allies as the de facto border. The line has been upheld in practice for over a century, and it forms the basis of India's administrative and legal framework in Arunachal Pradesh. The international community generally recognizes treaties that have been acted upon and maintained, even if there were initial disputes.

Secondly, the historical context you've provided is indeed crucial. However, it's important to note that the modern state of China, established after the 1949 revolution, has a different legal and administrative framework compared to the historical dynasties. The treaties and agreements from the Yuan Dynasty and subsequent periods do not have the same legal standing in the context of modern international law, which emphasizes contemporary sovereignty and administrative control.

Regarding UNCLOS Article 5, while inherited treaties are significant, the applicability here is more about the historical treaties and agreements that established China's sovereignty over the region. The McMahon Line, being a later agreement, does not supersede the earlier established sovereignty based on historical presence and administrative control.

I understand China's position on the historical and legal arguments supporting its claim. We are indeed committed to peaceful negotiations and maintaining stability in the region. Our goal is to find a mutually agreeable solution that respects historical facts and maintains regional peace.

We are open to dialogue, but we will not compromise on our sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh.
