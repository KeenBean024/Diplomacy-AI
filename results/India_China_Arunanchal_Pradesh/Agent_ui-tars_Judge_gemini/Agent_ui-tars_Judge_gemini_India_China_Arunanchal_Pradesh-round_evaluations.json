        "logical_consistency": {
            "reason": "Both agents present logically consistent arguments within their respective frameworks. Agent 1's argument hinges on the lack of formal ratification and historical precedence. Agent 2's argument relies on de facto recognition and current administrative control. The disagreement stems from differing interpretations of historical events and legal principles.",
            "value": 8
        },
        "rebuttal_effectiveness": {
            "reason": "Agent 1 attempts to rebut Agent 2's argument by questioning the validity of the McMahon Line due to the lack of Chinese ratification. Agent 2 counters by arguing that the McMahon Line has been consistently recognized and maintained in practice. The rebuttals are moderately effective in highlighting the opposing viewpoints but do not lead to any concessions.",

        "persuasiveness": {
            "reason": "Neither agent is particularly persuasive in this round. Both sides reiterate their core arguments without offering new compelling evidence or addressing the other's concerns in a way that would lead to a shift in position. The negotiation remains entrenched.",

        "argument_novelty_depth": {
            "reason": "There is a lack of novelty in this round. Both agents rehash previously stated arguments without delving into new aspects of the issue or providing deeper insights. The discussion remains at a relatively superficial level.",
