India: China, as a responsible member of the international community, firmly upholds the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. In the case of Arunachal Pradesh, we maintain that the region is an integral part of South Tibet, historically and legally part of China. This position is based on centuries of historical evidence and the traditional administrative control exercised by Chinese authorities over the area. We are committed to resolving this dispute through peaceful negotiations and mutual understanding, in line with our long-standing policy of maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries.
China: India, as a sovereign nation, upholds the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We maintain that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India, historically and legally. This position is based on the McMahon Line, which was established in 1914 and has been recognized by India and other nations. We are committed to resolving this dispute through peaceful negotiations and mutual understanding, in line with our long-standing policy of maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries.
India: China, I understand your position on Arunachal Pradesh, but I must emphasize that the McMahon Line, established in 1914, serves as the legal basis for India's claim. This agreement was reached between British India and Tibet, delineating the borders in the Eastern Himalayas. Furthermore, the current administrative governance structures in Arunachal Pradesh, as part of India, reflect its integration into our sovereign territory. The demographic data from the 2021 Census also supports the region's status as an integral part of India, with a population that identifies with Indian citizenship and governance. We are open to dialogue, but we stand firm on our legal and historical claims.
China: India, I appreciate your emphasis on the McMahon Line, but it's important to note that China has never recognized this agreement. The historical context predates the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and we maintain that the region of Arunachal Pradesh, which we refer to as South Tibet, has been part of Chinese territory for centuries. The traditional administrative control and cultural ties of the region with Tibet further support our claim. We acknowledge the current administrative setup, but we believe that historical sovereignty and territorial integrity should be the guiding principles. We are willing to engage in discussions to find a mutually agreeable solution that respects both nations' interests.
India: China, I understand your historical perspective on Arunachal Pradesh, but it's crucial to recognize the legal framework established post-1947, which includes the McMahon Line as an internationally recognized boundary. The region's integration into India's administrative structure and its demographic alignment with Indian citizenship reinforce our claim. We acknowledge the importance of historical sovereignty, but the current geopolitical realities and legal agreements must also be considered. We are open to constructive dialogue to address concerns and find a resolution that respects both nations' interests.
China: India, I appreciate your focus on the legal framework post-1947, but it's essential to consider the broader historical context and the traditional administrative control exercised by China over the region. The McMahon Line, while significant, was not recognized by China, and our claim is supported by centuries of historical evidence. We recognize the current administrative setup but believe that historical sovereignty and territorial integrity should be prioritized. We are open to discussions that acknowledge both our historical claims and the current realities, aiming for a resolution that benefits both nations.
India: China, I understand your emphasis on historical sovereignty, but it's important to acknowledge the legal agreements and international recognition that have shaped the current territorial status of Arunachal Pradesh.

The region's integration into India's administrative and demographic framework further solidifies its status as an integral part of our sovereign territory. We are open to dialogue, but we must also consider the legal and administrative realities that have evolved over the past century.

India: China, I understand your proposal for a joint administration model, but it's important to consider the current administrative governance structures and demographic realities in Arunachal Pradesh. The region is fully integrated into India's administrative framework, with its population identifying as Indian citizens. Imposing a joint administration could disrupt the existing social and administrative harmony. Instead, we propose maintaining the status quo, where both nations agree to peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity. This approach acknowledges the current realities while fostering continued dialogue and cooperation between our nations.
China: India, I understand your concerns about the potential disruption of existing social and administrative harmony in Arunachal Pradesh. However, it's crucial to recognize that China's historical claims and cultural ties to the region are deeply rooted and cannot be overlooked. The joint administration model we proposed aims to address these historical claims while also respecting the current realities on the ground. This model would allow both nations to exercise sovereignty over the disputed area, fostering cooperation and mutual understanding. We believe that this approach could lead to a more equitable and sustainable resolution, acknowledging the legitimate interests of both China and India. We are open to further discussions to refine this proposal and ensure it meets the needs and concerns of both parties.
