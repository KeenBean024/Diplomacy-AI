        "logical_consistency": {
            "reason": "Both agents present logically consistent arguments, building upon their initial positions and offering proposals that align with their stated goals. The proposals for joint administration and a bilateral commission are logically connected to the desire for peaceful coexistence and cooperation.",
            "value": 8
        },
        "rebuttal_effectiveness": {
            "reason": "Both agents acknowledge the other's perspective but reiterate their own arguments. The rebuttals are not particularly strong or persuasive, as they primarily restate existing claims rather than directly addressing the other side's concerns.",
            "value": 4
        },
        "persuasiveness": {
            "reason": "The persuasiveness is moderate. While both agents express a willingness to engage in dialogue and consider cooperative solutions, they do not offer compelling reasons for the other side to significantly alter their position. The proposals are more about maintaining the status quo and fostering communication than about resolving the underlying territorial dispute.",
            "value": 5
        },
        "argument_novelty_depth": {
            "reason": "The arguments presented in this round lack significant novelty or depth. Both agents primarily reiterate their existing positions and offer relatively superficial proposals for cooperation. There is no in-depth exploration of the historical, legal, or demographic complexities of the issue.",
            "value": 3
