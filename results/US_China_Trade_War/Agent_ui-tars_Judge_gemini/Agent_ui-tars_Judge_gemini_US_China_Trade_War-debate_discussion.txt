China: The ongoing U.S.-China trade war indeed highlights significant tensions between the world's two largest economies. The United States has taken measures such as imposing tariffs and export bans, ostensibly to address concerns over unfair Chinese trade practices, intellectual property violations, and national security threats. However, from China's perspective, these actions represent a form of economic protectionism aimed at curtailing China's rise as a global economic power.

China maintains that its economic growth is driven by innovation, hard work, and a commitment to WTO rules. We believe in open trade and mutual benefits, as evidenced by our extensive economic interactions with the U.S. over the past decades. The trade imbalance, often cited by the U.S., is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including global supply chains and consumer demand.

China's development model, initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1992, has been instrumental in lifting millions out of poverty and integrating China into the global economy. Our approach to technology transfer through joint ventures is a voluntary process that has benefited both Chinese and foreign companies, fostering innovation and mutual growth.

We stand firm in our commitment to WTO compliance and advocate for a rules-based international trade system. The unilateral actions taken by the U.S. undermine these principles and threaten global economic stability. We call for dialogue and cooperation to resolve differences, ensuring that both nations can continue to prosper together in an interconnected world.
United_States: The ongoing U.S.-China trade war indeed highlights significant tensions between the world's two largest economies. The United States has taken measures such as imposing tariffs and export bans, ostensibly to address concerns over unfair Chinese trade practices, intellectual property violations, and national security threats. These actions are rooted in a long-standing commitment to economic fairness and national security.

The U.S. has raised concerns over intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and cyber-espionage by China, which undermine fair competition and innovation. The massive trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, favoring China, is another critical issue. This imbalance is exacerbated by China's unfair export advantages, including subsidies and market restrictions that distort global trade.

The U.S. has justified trade restrictions under national security exceptions, particularly concerning advanced technologies like those provided by Huawei. These measures aim to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information from potential vulnerabilities.

Historically, the U.S. has used tariffs as a tool to address unfair trade practices, as seen in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. While that act is often criticized, it reflects a long-standing approach to protecting domestic industries and ensuring reciprocal trade relations, principles enshrined in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.

The U.S. remains committed to WTO compliance and a rules-based international trade system. Our actions are defensive, aimed at addressing specific trade injustices and ensuring a level playing field for all nations. We seek to restore balance and fairness in global trade, ensuring that all countries, including China, adhere to international norms and standards.
